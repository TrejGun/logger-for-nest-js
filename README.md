# Logger from Nest.js

This is a code sample for my [article](https://trejgun.github.io/articles/logger-for-nestjs)


## Manual installation

I assume you have node, yarn/npm, postgres

First of all you have to download dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Then check config in
```bash
nano .env
```

and start in watch mode
```bash
npm run start
```

or in production mode
```bash
npm run build
npm run prod
```

## Docker

Otherwise you can use docker

```shell script
docker-compose up --build
```
